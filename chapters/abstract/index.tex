\chapter*{Abstract}
In this work we perform a \textsc{qcd} analysis on hadronic \(\tau\) lepton
decays. We make use of the \textsc{aleph} data to fit the strong coupling and
higher order \textsc{ope} contributions. Our approach is based on the
\textsc{qcdsr}, especially the framework of \textsc{fopt}, which we apply for
the \(V+A\) channel of the inclusive Cabibbo\-/allowed hadronic \(\tau\) decay
data. We perform this fits using a new set of analytic weight functions to shed
light on the discussion of the importance of \textsc{dv} while determining the
strong coupling \(\alpha_s\) at the \(m_\tau^2\) scale. We found a value of
\(\alpha_s(m_\tau^2) = 0.3308(44)\) for the strong coupling. While performing
fits using differently pinched weights we showed that \textsc{dv} play only a
minor role, even for single pinched weights, if the fits are performed in the
\(V+A\) channel, using \textsc{fopt} and for an \(s_{min} \gtrapprox
\SI{2.1}{\giga\eV}\). In comparing fits performed in the framework of the
\textsc{bs} we found strong arguments favouring \textsc{fopt} and discourage the
use of \textsc{cipt}.
