\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr. Matthias Jamin
for his continuous support, for his motivation and for his enormous knowledge. I
specially thank him for not giving up on me even in complicated times.

I want to thank my university \textsc{UAB} and the Institute \textsc{ifae} for
guiding me through every obstacle and offering plentiful events to widen my
research from various perspectives. I am especially greatful for the oportunity
to grow as a teacher of many gifted students.

Having spent four months at the \textsc{cpt}/\textsc{cnrs} in Marseille I also
want to thank the Universit√© d'Aix-Marseille for offering me this opportunity. I
particularly thank Dr. Marc Knecht who perfectly organised my two stays and Dr.
Laurent Lellouch and Dr. Aoife Bharucha, who were more than welcoming.

I want to thank Ramon Miravtillas Mas and Xabier Lobregat for guiding me
throughout this thesis. Notably Ramon helped me out with his tremendous
mathematical knowledge.

Last but not least, I would like to thank the persons closest to me. My parents
for being as supportive as ever, my sister for her motivational speeches and
Beata for just being there, when needed.
