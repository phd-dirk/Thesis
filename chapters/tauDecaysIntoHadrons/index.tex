\chapter{Tau Decays into Hadrons}
The tau lepton is an elementary particle with spin \(1/2\) and as mass of
\SI{1.77686}{\giga\eV} \cite{PDG2018}. It is the only lepton heavy enough to
decay into hadrons but also light enough for performing a low\-/energy
\textsc{qcd} analysis.  Its inclusive hadronic\footnote{Meaning all decay channels
  with a hadron in its final state.} decay ratio
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:inclusiveRatio}
  R_\tau = \frac{\Gamma(\tau \to \nu_\tau + \text{hadrons})}{\Gamma(\tau \to \nu_\tau e^+ e^-)}
\end{equation}
is furthermore sensible to the strong coupling
\(\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)\). As the \textsc{np} contributions to the decay ratio are
suppressed, the dominant perturbative contributions are known up to
\(\mathcal(\alpha_s^4)\), which allow precise calculations of \cref{eq:inclusiveRatio}. 
By extracting \(\alpha_s\) at low energies at the scale of \(m_\tau^2\) we will
achieve lower errors for the strong coupling at higher energies as the errors run
with the strong coupling and get smaller with increasing the energy. All in all
it permits one of the most precise determinations of the
strong coupling \(\alpha_s\).


\textcolor{red}{add list of advantages of tau decays for extracting strong
  coupling \cite{Pich2016a}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(tau\) mass is large enough for \(\alpha_s\) to be small enough
    (\(\alpha(m_\tau^2) \approx 0.33 \)) to make use of the \textsc{ope}, even
    for values lower than \(s_0 = m_\tau\).
  \item On the other hand \(alpha_s\) is large enough for the inclusive \(\tau\)
    decay ratio \(R_\tau\) to be sensitive to it. 
  \item The perturbative correction is known up to order
    \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)\) and has a total contribution of \(20\%\).
  \item We can apply weights, like the kinematic weight, to suppress \textsc{dv}.
  \item The dimension two contribution of the \textsc{ope} is proportional to
    the quark masses and has only a tiny contribution for light quarks.
  \item The dimension four contribution of the \textsc{ope} can be suppressed by
    applying weights. E.g. the kinematic weight
    \(\omega_\tau=(1-x)^2(1+2x)=1-3x^2+2x^3\) is only sensitive to \textsc{ope}
    corrections of dimension six and eight (not to dimension four).
  \item The dimension six contribution of the \textsc{ope} is further suppressed
    in the \textsc{v+a} channel as the vector and axial\-/vector \(D=6\)
    contributions have opposite signs and cancel themselves.
  \item Higher dimensional \textsc{ope} contributions are suppressed by terms
    \(1/m_\tau^n\) with \(n \leq 8\).
\end{itemize}

Building on the previously presented \textsc{qcdsr} we will elaborate the needed
theory to extract \(\alpha_s\) from the process of hadronic tau decays.


\section{The Inclusive Decay Ratio}
The theoretical expression of the inclusive hadronic decay ratio
(\cref{eq:inclusiveRatio}) is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hadronicTauDecayRatio}
  R_\tau(s) = 12 \pi S_{EW} \abs{V_{ud}}^2 \int_0^{m_\tau} \frac{\dif s}{m_\tau^2}
  \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
  \left[ \left( 1 + 2 \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \Ima \Pi^{(1)}(s) + \Ima \Pi^{(0)}(s) \right],
\end{equation}
where \(S_{EW}\) is the electro\-/weak correction, \(V_{ud}\) the corresponding
\define{ckm}{Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa} matrix element and $\Ima \Pi$ the
imaginary part of the two-point function we introduced in
\cref{sec:twoPointFunction}. For brevity we will omit the electro\-/weak
\(S_{EW}\) and \textsc{ckm} factors from now on. \Cref{eq:hadronicTauDecayRatio}
was first derived by \cite{Tsai1971}, using current algebra, a more recent
derivation making use of the \textit{optical theorem}, as already mentioned in
\cref{sec:twoPointFunction} can be taken from \cite{Schwab2002}. Notice that we
used the standard lorentz decomposition into transversal (\(J=1\)) and
longitudinal \(J=0\) components of
\cref{eq:eq:correlatorTransversalLongitudinalDecomposition} to display the
hadronic decay ratio (\cref{eq:hadronicTauDecayRatio}).

Applying Cauchy's theorem, as seen in \cref{eq:qcdSumRules}, to the
\cref{eq:hadronicTauDecayRatio} we can rewrite the line integral into a closed
contour integral
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rTauT+L}
  R_\tau = 6 \pi i \oint_{s=m_\tau} \frac{\dif s}{m_\tau^2}
  \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
  \left[ \left( 1 + 2 \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \Pi^{(1)}(s) + \Pi^{(0)}(s) \right].
\end{equation}
It is convenient to work with a slightly different combination of transversal
and longitudinal components \(\Pi^{(1+0)}\), which has been defined in
\cref{eq:correlatorCombination} and is free of kinematic singularities. As a
result we can further rewrite the hadronic tau decay ratio into
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tauDecayRatioT+L}
  R_\tau = 6 \pi i \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau} \frac{\dif s}{m_\tau^2}
  \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^2
  \left[ \left( 1 + 2 \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \Pi^{(1+0)}(s) - \left( \frac{2 s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \Pi^{(0)}(s) \right].
\end{equation}
In the case of tau decays we only have to consider vector and axial-vector
contributions of decays into up, down and strange quarks. Thus taking $i,j$ as
the flavour indices for the light quarks (u, d and s) we can express the
two\-/point function as
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{\mu\nu,ij}^{V/A}(s) \equiv i \int \dif x \,e^{ipx} \langle \Omega | T \{ J_{\mu,ij}^{V/A}(x) J_{\nu,ij}^{V/A}(0)^\dagger \} | \Omega \rangle,
\end{equation}
with $|\Omega\rangle$ being the physical vacuum. The vector and axial-vector
currents are then distinguished by the corresponding dirac-matrices ($\gamma_\mu
\text{and} \gamma_\mu \gamma_5$) given by
\begin{equation}
  J_{\mu,ij}^{V}(x) = \anti{q}_j(x) \gamma_\mu q_i(x) \quad \text{and} \quad J_{\mu,ij}^{A}(x) = \anti{q}_j(x) \gamma_\mu \gamma_5 q_i(x).
\end{equation}

With \cref{eq:tauDecayRatioT+L} we have a suitable physical quantity that can be
theoretically calculated as experimentally measured. By using the \textsc{qcdsr}
we apply a closed contour integral of radius \(s_0\). As a result we
successfully avoided low energies at which the application of \textsc{pt} would
be questionable. For example if we would choose a radius with the size of the
tau mass \(m_\tau \approx \SI{1.78}{\mega\eV}\) the strong coupling would have a
perturbatively safe value of \(\alpha_s(m_\tau)\approx 0.33\) \cite{Pich2016}.
Obviously we would benefit even more from a contour integral over a bigger
circumference, but tau decays are limited by their mass. Nevertheless there are
promising \(e^+e^-\) annihilation data, which yields valuable inclusive decay ratio values up to
\SI{2}{\giga\eV} \cite{Boito2018}\cite{Keshavarzi2018}.


\subsection{Renormalisation Group Invariance}
We have seen in \cref{sec:twoPointFunction}, that the two-point function is not
a physical quantity. From the dispersion relation (\cref{eq:dispersionRelation})
we saw that it contains a unphysical polynom. Luckily for the vector correlator,
appearing in hadronic tau decays, the polynom is just a constant. Consequently
by taking the derivative with respect to the momentum \(s\) we can derive a
physical quantity from the two\-/point function:
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  D(s) \equiv -s \od{}{s} \Pi(s).
\end{tcolorbox}
\(D(s)\) is called the \textit{Adler function} and fulfils the \textsc{rge}
(\cref{eq:RGE}). The Adler function commonly has separate definitions for the
longitudinal plus transversal and the solely longitudinal contributions:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:adlerFunction}
  D^{(1+0)}(s) \equiv -s \od{}{s} \Pi^{(1+0)}(s), \qquad D^{(0)}(s) \equiv \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \od{}{s} (s \Pi^{(0)}(s)).
\end{equation}
The two\-/point functions in \cref{eq:tauDecayRationT+L} can now be replaced with
the help of partial integration
\begin{equation}
  \int_a^b u(x) V(x) \dif x = \left[ U(x) V(x) \right]_a^b - \int_a^b U(x) v(x) \dif x.
\end{equation}
We will do the computation for each of the two cases \((1+0)\) and \((0)\) separate.
Starting by the transversal plus longitudinal contribution we get:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    R_\tau^{(1)} &= \frac{6 \pi i}{m_\tau^2}
    \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2}\underbrace{ \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^2
      \left( 1 + 2 \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
    }_{= u(x)} \underbrace{ \vphantom{\left( \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)} \Pi^{(1+0)}(s)}_{=V(x)} \\
    &= \frac{6 \pi i}{m_\tau^2} \left\{ \left[ -\frac{m_\tau^2}{2} \left( 1 -
          \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^3 \left( 1 + \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
        \Pi^{(1+0)}(s) \right]_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \right. \\
    &\quad+ \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \underbrace{-\frac{m_\tau^2}{2} \left( 1 -
        \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^3 \left( 1 + \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
    }_{=U(x)} \underbrace{\vphantom{\left( \frac{1}{m_\tau^2} \right)}\od{}{s}
      \Pi^{(1+0)}(s)}_{=v(x)}
    \left. \vphantom{\left[ \left( \frac{1}{m_\tau^2} \right) \right]} \right\} \\
    &= -3 \pi i \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2s} \frac{\dif s}{s} \left( 1 -
      \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^3 \left( 1 + \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)
    \od{}{s} D^{(1+0)}(s)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we fixed the integration constant to \(c=-\frac{m_\tau^2}{2}\) in the second
line and left the antiderivatives contained in the squared brackets untouched.
If we parameterizing the integral appearing in the expression in the squared
brackets we can see that it vanishes:
\begin{equation}
  \left[ -\frac{m_\tau^2}{2} \left( 1 - e^{-i \phi} \right)^3 \left( 1 + e^{-i \phi} \right) \Pi^{(L+T)}(m_\tau^2 e^{-i \phi}) \right]_0^{2\pi} = 0,
\end{equation}
where \(s \to m_\tau^2 e^{-i \phi}\) and \((1 - e^{-i \cdot 0}) = (1 - e^{-i
  \cdot 2 \pi}) = 0\). Repeating the same calculation for the longitudinal part
yields
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    R_\tau^{(0)} &= \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \dif s \left( 1 -
      \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^2
    \left( - \frac{2 s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \Pi^{(0)}(s) \\
    &= - 4 \pi i \oint \frac{\dif s}{s} \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^3
    D^{(0)}(s)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Consequently combining the transversal with the longitudinal contribution results in
\begin{equation}
  R_\tau = - \pi i \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \frac{\dif s}{s}
  \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^3
  \left[ 3 \left( 1 + \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} D^{(1+0)}(s) + 4 D^{(0)}(s) \right) \right].
\end{equation}
It is convenient to define \(x=s/m_\tau^2\) such that we can rewrite the
inclusive ratio as
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  \label{eq:rTauFinal}
  R_\tau = - \pi i \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \frac{\dif x}{x} (1 - x)^3 \left[ 3
    (1 + x) D^{(1+0)}(m_\tau^2 x) + 4 D^{(0)}(m_\tau^2 x) \right],
\end{tcolorbox}
which will be the final expression we will be using to express the inclusive tau
decay ratio.



\section{Theoretical computation of \(R_\tau\)}
The previously derived expression for the tau decay ratio is at a first
approximation equal to the number of colours \cite{Peskin1995}
\begin{equation}
  R_\tau \approx N_c.
\end{equation} 
If we take into account the \textsc{ckm} matrix
\(V_{ud}\) and the perturbative \(\delta_{pt}\), non\-/perturbative
\(\delta_{npt}\) and electroweak corrections \(S_{EW}\) we can organise the
vector and axial\-/vector inclusive decay ratio as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rTauContributions}
  R_{\tau,V/A}^\omega = \frac{N_c}{2}S_{EW} \abs{V_{ud}}^2 \left( 1 + \delta_{pt}^{\omega} + \delta_{npt}^{\omega} \right).
\end{equation}
Note that the factor \(1/2\) comes from the fact that in the chiral limit the
vector and axial\-/vector contributions are equal and that the perturbative and
non\-/perturbative corrections depend on the chosen weight function \(\omega\).

For the kinematic weight
\begin{equation}
  \omega_\tau \equiv (1-x)^2(1+2x),
\end{equation}
we have a dominant perturbative contribution of \(\delta_{pt} \approx 20\%\)
\cite{Pich2013} and a minor, but not negligible, non\-/perturbative contribution
of \(\delta_{npt} = -0.007 \pm 0.004\) \cite{Braaten1991}.

We now want to derive the theoretical expressions needed to calculate both of
the corrections to \cref{eq:rTauContributions} starting with the perturbative
one.


\subsection{The perturbative contribution}
The perturbative contribution \(\delta_{pt}\) to the inclusive tau decay ratio
is given as the first term of the \textsc{ope}. Currently the perturbative
expansion has been calculated to fourth order \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_i^4)\). Due
to their role as dominant corrections their uncertainties from unknown
higher-order corrections dictate the final error of the determination of the
strong coupling \cite{Pich2016}.

We will treat the correlator in the chiral limit, in which the scalar and
pseudo\-/scalar contribution of the two\-/point function vanish and the axial
and vectorial contributions are equal. As a result we can focus ourselves of the
vector correlator \(\Pi_V(s)\), which can be expanded as a sum over different
orders of \(\alpha\) \cite{Beneke2008}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:correlatorExpansion}
  \Pi_V^{(1+0)}(s) = - \frac{N_c}{12 \pi^2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_\mu^n \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} c_{n,k} L^{k} \quad \text{with} \quad L \equiv \ln \frac{-s}{\mu^2},
\end{equation}
where we defined \(a_s \equiv \alpha/ \pi\). The coefficient \(c_{n,k}\) up to
two-loop order can be obtained by Feynman diagram calculations. With the
diagrams of \cref{fig:perturbativeContributionFeynmanDiagrams} we can calculate
the zero-loop result of the correlator \cite{Jamin2006}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/correlatorLoopDiagrams.eps}
  \caption{Feynman loop diagrams to calculate the \(c_{n,k}\) coefficients of
    the expanded correlator \(\Pi_V^{(1+0)}\). The internal red lines represent
    gluons. Diagram a) represents the parton model and diagrams b) and c)
    represent higher order corrections.}
  \label{fig:perturbativeContributionFeynmanDiagrams}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
  \left. \Pi^B_{\mu\nu}(q^2) \right\rvert^{1-loop} = \frac{N_c}{12\pi^2} \left( \frac{1}{\hat \epsilon} - \log\frac{(-q^2 - i0)}{\mu^2} + \frac{5}{3} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon) \right),
\end{equation}
where \(\Pi^B_{\mu\nu}(q^2)\) is the bare two\-/point function and is not
renormalised\footnote{The term \(1/ \hat \epsilon\), which is of order zero in
  \(\alpha_s\), will vanish by applying renormalisation.}. This result can then
be used to extract the first two coefficients of the correlator expansion given
in \cref{eq:correlatorExpansion}
\begin{equation}
  c_{00} = - \frac{5}{3} \qquad \text{and} \qquad c_{01} = 1.
\end{equation}

The second loop can also be calculated by diagram techniques resulting in
\cite{Boito2011}
\begin{equation}
  \left. \Pi_V^{(1+0)}(s) \right\rvert^{2-loop} = -\frac{N_c}{12\pi^2} a_\mu \log(\frac{-s}{\mu^2}) + \cdots
\end{equation}
yielding $c_{11} = 1$.

Beginning from three loop diagrams the algebra becomes exhausting and one has to
use dedicated algorithms to compute the higher loops. The third loop
calculations have been done in the late seventies by
\cite{Chetyrkin1979,Dine1979,Celmaster1979}. The four loop evaluation have been
completed a little more than ten years later by
\cite{Gorishnii1990,Surguladze1990}. The highest loop published, that amounts to
$\alpha_s^4$, was published in 2008 \cite{Baikov2008} almost 20 years later.

Fixing the number of colors to $N_c=3$ the missing coefficients up to order four
in $\alpha_s$ read:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:adlerCoefficients}
  \begin{split}
    c_{2,1} &= \frac{365}{24} - 11 \zeta_3 - \left( \frac{11}{12} - \frac{2}{3}\zeta_3 \right) N_f \\
    c_{3,1} &= \frac{87029}{288} - \frac{1103}{4} \zeta_3 + \frac{275}{6}\zeta_5 \\
    &- \left( \frac{7847}{216} - \frac{262}{9} \zeta_3 + \frac{25}{9} \zeta_5 \right) N_f + \left( \frac{151}{162} - \frac{19}{27}\zeta_3\right)N_f^2 \\
    c_{4,1} &= \frac{78631453}{20736} - \frac{1704247}{432}\zeta_3 +
    \frac{4185}{8}\zeta_3^2 + \frac{34165}{96}\zeta_5 - \frac{1995}{16}\zeta_7,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where used the flavor number $N_f=3$ for the last line.

The 6-loop calculation has until today not been achieved, but Beneke and Jamin
\cite{Beneke2008} used and educated guess to estimate the coefficient
\begin{equation}
  c_{5,1} \approx 283 \pm 283.
\end{equation}
We often see \(c_{5,1}\) applied to estimate the perturbative errors, due to
missing orders.

In stating the coefficients \(c_{n,k}\) of the correlator expansion we have
restricted ourselves to \(k\)\-/indices equal to one. This is due to the
\textsc{rge}, which relates coefficients with \(k\) different than one to the
already stated coefficients \(c_{n,1}\). To relate the coefficients we have to
make use of the \textsc{rge}. Consequently the correlator \(\Pi_V^{1+0}(s)\)
needs to be a physical quantity, which we can be achieved with the previously
defined Adler function (\cref{eq:adlerFunction}). The correct expression for the
correlator expansion in \cref{eq:correlatorExpansion} is then given by
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  D_V^{(1+0)} = - s \od{\Pi_V^{(1+0)}(s)}{s} = \frac{N_c}{12 \pi^2}
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_\mu^n \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k c_{n,k} L^{k-1},
\end{tcolorbox}
where we used \(\dif L^k/ \dif s=k\ln(-s/\mu^2)^{k-1}(-1/\mu^2)\). Applying the
\textsc{rge} (\cref{eq:rge}) to the scale\-/invariant Adler function yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rgeAdler}
  -\mu \od{}{\mu} D_V^{(1+0)} = -\mu \od{}{\mu} \left( \pd{}{L} \dif L + \pd{}{a_s} \dif a_s \right) D_V^{(1+0)}
  = \left( 2\pd{}{L} + \beta \pd{}{a_s} \right) D_V^{(1+0)} = 0,
\end{equation}
where we made use of the \(\beta\) function, which is defined in
\cref{eq:betaFunction}, and of the expression \(\dif L / \dif \mu = - 2/ \mu\).

The relation between the correlator expansion coefficients can then be taken by
calculating the Adler function for a desired order and plugging it into the
\textsc{rge}. For example the Adler function to the second order in \(\alpha_s\)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:adler2ndOrder}
  D(s) = \frac{N_c}{12 \pi^2} \left[ c_{01} + a_\mu(c_{11} + 2 c_{12} L) + a_\mu^2(c_{21} + 2 c_{22} L + 3 c_{23} L^2) \right],
\end{equation}
can be inserted into the \cref{eq:rgeAdler}
\begin{equation}
  4 a_\mu c_{12} + 2 a_\mu^2(2 c_{22} + 6 c_{23} L) + \beta_1 a_\mu^2(c_{11} + 2 c_{12}L) + \mathcal{O}(a_\mu^3) = 0
\end{equation}
to compare the coefficients order by order in \(\alpha_s\). At order
\(\alpha_\mu\) only the \(c_{12}\) term is present and has consequently to be
zero. For \(\mathcal{O}(a_\mu^2 L)\) solely \(c_{23}\) exists as \(c_{12}=0\)
and thus also has to vanish. Finally for \(\mathcal{O}(a)\) we can relate
\(c_{22}\) with \(c_{11}\) resulting in:
\begin{equation}
  c_{12} = 0, \quad c_{22} = \frac{\beta_1 c_{11}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad c_{23} = 0.
\end{equation}
Implementing the newly obtained Adler coefficients we can write out the Adler
function to the first order:
\begin{equation}
  D(s) = \frac{N_c}{12 \pi^2} \left[ c_{01} + c_{11} a_\mu \left( c_{21} - \frac{1}{2} \beta_1 c_{11} L  \right) a_\mu^2 \right] + \mathcal{O}(a_\mu^3).
\end{equation}

We have used the \textsc{rge} to relate Adler function coefficients and thus
only need to know coefficients of type \(c_{n,1}\). Unfortunately, as we will
see in the following section the \textsc{rge} gives us two different choices in
the order of the computation of the perturbative contribution to the inclusive
tau decay ratio.

\subsubsection{Renormalization group summation}
By making use of the \textsc{rge} we have to decide about the order of
mathematical operations we perform. As the perturbative contribution
\(\delta_{pt}}\) is independent on the scale \(\mu\) we are confronted with two
choices \define{fopt}{fixed\-/order perturbation theory} or
\define{cipt}{contour\-/improved perturbation theory}. Each of them yields a
different result, which is the main source of error in extracting the strong
coupling from tau decays.

We can write the perturbative contribution \(\delta_{pt}\) of \(R_\tau\)
(\cref{eq:rTauContributions}) in the chiral limit, such that the longitudinal
contribution \(D^{(0)}\), in \cref{eq:rTauFinal} vanishes. Thus inserting the
expansion of \(D_V^{(1+0)}\) into the hadronic tau decay width
\cref{eq:rTauFinal} yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rTauDelta0}
  \delta_{pt} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_\mu^n \sum_{k=1}^n k c_{n,k} \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\abs{x}=1} \frac{\dif x}{x} (1-x)^3(1+x) \log \left( \frac{-m_\tau^2 x}{\mu^2} \right)^{k-1}.
\end{equation}
Keep in mind that the contributions from the vector and axial-vector correlator
are identical in the massless case.

To continue evaluating the perturbative part we can now either follow the
description of \textsc{fopt} or \textsc{cipt}. We will now present both.

In \textsc{fopt} we fix the scale at the tau mass (\(\mu^2=m_\tau^2\)), which
leaves us with the integration over the logarithm, as seen in
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{FO}^{(0)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a(m_\tau^2)^n \sum_{k=1}^n k c_{n,k} J_{k-1}
\end{equation}
where the contour integrals \(J_l\) are defined by
\begin{equation}
  J_l \equiv \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\abs{x}=1} \frac{\dif x}{x} (1-x)^3(1+x) \log^l(-x).
\end{equation}
The integrals \(J_l\) up to order \(\alpha_s^4\) are given by \cite{Beneke2008}:
\begin{equation}
  J_0 = 1, \quad J_1 = -\frac{19}{12} \quad J_2 = \frac{265}{72} - \frac{1}{3} \pi^2, \quad J_3 = - \frac{3355}{288} + \frac{19}{12}\pi^2.
\end{equation}
Using \textsc{fopt} the strong coupling \(a(\mu)\) is fixed at the tau mass
scale \(a(m_\tau^2)\) and can be taken out of the closed-contour integral. Thus
we solely have to integrate over the logarithms \(\log(x)\).

Using \textsc{cipt} we can sum the logarithms by setting the scale to \(\mu^2 =
-m_\tau^2 x\) in \cref{eq:rTauDelta0}, resulting in:
\begin{equation}
  \delta^{(0)}_{CI} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_{n,1} J_n^a(m_\tau^2),
\end{equation}
where the contour integrals $J_l$ are defined by
\begin{equation}
  J_n^a(m_\tau^2) \equiv \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\abs{x}=1} \frac{\dif x}{x} (1-x)^3(1+x) a^n(-m_\tau^2 x).
\end{equation}
Note that all logarithms vanish, except the ones with index \(k=1\):
\begin{equation}
  \log(1)^{k-1} =  \begin{cases} \mbox{1} & \mbox{if } k=1, \\ \mbox{0} & k\neq 1 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
which selects the Adler function coefficients \(c_{n,1}\). Handling the
logarithms left us with the integration of \(\alpha_s(- m_\tau^2 x)\) over the
closed-contour \(\oint_{\abs{x}=1}\), which now depends on the integration
variable \(x\).

In general we have to decide if we want to perform a contour integration with a
constant coupling constant and variable logarithms (\textsc{fopt}) or ``constant
logarithms'' and a running coupling (\textsc{cipt}). To emphasize the
differences in both approaches we can calculate the perturbative contribution
\(\delta^{(0)}\) to \(R_\tau\) for the two different prescriptions yielding
\cite{Beneke2008}
\begin{align}
  & \quad\qquad \alpha_s^2 \qquad \alpha_s^2 \qquad \alpha_s^3 \qquad \alpha_s^4 \quad\qquad \alpha_s^5 \nonumber\\
  \delta_{FO}^{(0)} &= 0.1082 + 0.0609 + 0.0334 + 0.0174 (+ 0.0088) = 0.2200 (0.2288) \\
  \delta_{CI}^{(0)} &= 0.1479 + 0.0297 + 0.0122 + 0.0086 (+ 0.0038) = 0.1984 (0.2021).
\end{align}
The series indicate, that \textsc{cipt} converges faster and that both series
approach a different value. This discrepancy represents currently the biggest
theoretical uncertainty while extracting the strong coupling.

As today we do not know if \textsc{fopt} or \textsc{cipt} is the correct
approach of measuring the strong coupling. As a result there are currently three
ways of stating results: Quoting the average of both results, quoting the
\textsc{cipt} result or quoting the \textsc{fopt} result. We follow the approach
of Beneke and Jamin \cite{Beneke2008} who prefere \textsc{fopt}, but also state
their results in \textsc{cipt}.


\subsection{The Non-Perturbative OPE Contribution}
The perturbative contribution to the sum rule is the dominant one, but
\textsc{np} have to be taken into account. The contribution of the \textsc{npt}
part can be quoted as
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{NP} = 0,007 \pm 0.004 \qquad \cite{Braaten1991},
\end{equation}
which is small, but not negligible. The \textsc{np} \textsc{ope} contributions
are commonly categorised by even, increasing dimensions. Contributions of
dimension larger than eight are normally neglected, due to the increasing
suppression by factors of \(1/m_\tau^{2D}\), where \(D\) stands for the
corresponding dimension.

The dimension two contributions are proportional to the quark masses and vanish
while working in the chiral limit. Consequently we will neglect them.

\subsection{Dimension four}
The next apparent \textsc{ope} contribution is of dimension four. Here we have
to take into account the terms with masses to the fourth power $m^4$, the quark
condensate multiplied by a mass $m \langle \anti{q} q \rangle$ and the gluon
condensate $\langle GG \rangle$. The resulting expression can be taken from the
appendix of \cite{Pich1999}, yielding:
\begin{equation}
  \left. D_{ij}^{(1+0)}(s) \right\rvert_{D=4} = \frac{1}{s^2} \sum_n \Omega^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2)a^n,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Omega_n^{(1+0)} (s/\mu^2) &\,=\, \frac{1}{6}\langle aGG \rangle p_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2) + \sum_k m_k \langle \anti{q}_k q_k \rangle r_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2) \\
    &\,+ 2\langle m_i \anti{q}_i q_i + m_j \anti{q}_j q_j \rangle q_n^{(1+0)} (s/\mu^2) \pm \frac{8}{3} \langle m_j \anti{q}_i q_i + m_i \anti{q}_j q_j \rangle t_n^{(1+0)} \\
    &\,- \frac{3}{\pi^2} (m_i^4 + m_j^4) h_n^{(1+0)} (s/\mu^2) \mp \frac{5}{\pi^2} m_i m_j (m_i^2 + m_j^2) k_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2)\\
    &\,+ \frac{3}{\pi^2} m_i^2 m_j^2 g_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2) + \sum_k m_k^4
    j_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2) + 2 \sum_{k \neq l} m_k^2 m_l^2 u_n^{(1+0)}(s/\mu^2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The perturbative expansion coefficients are known to $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ for the
condensate contributions,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    p_0^{(1+0)}=0, & p_1^{(1+0)}=1, & p_2^{(1+0)}=\frac{7}{6}, \\
    r_0^{(1+0)}=0, & r_1^{(1+0)}=0, & r_2^{(1+0)}=-\frac{5}{3}+\frac{8}{3}\zeta_3-\frac{2}{3}\log(s/\mu^2), \\
    q_0^{(1+0)}=1, & q_1^{(1+0)}=-1, & q_2^{(1+0)}=-\frac{131}{24}+\frac{9}{4}\log(s/\mu^2) \\
    t_0^{(1+0)}=0 & t_1^{(1+0)}=1, & t_2^{(1+0)}=\frac{17}{2}+\frac{9}{2}\log(s/\mu^2).
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
while the $m^4$ terms have been only computed to $\mathcal{O}(a)$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    h_0^{(1+0)}=1-1/2 \log(s/\mu^2), & h_1^{(1+0)}=\frac{25}{4}-2\zeta_3-\frac{25}{6}\log(s/\mu^2)-2 \log(s/\mu^2)^2, \\
    k_0^{(1+0)}=0, & k_1^{(1+0)}=1-\frac{2}{5}\log(s/\mu^2), \\
    g_0^{(1+0)}=1, & g_1^{(1+0)}=\frac{94}{9}-\frac{4}{3}\zeta_3-4 \log(s/\mu^2), \\
    j_0^{(1+0)}=0, & j_1^{(1+0)}=0, \\
    u_0^{(1+0)}=0, & u_2^{(1+0)}=0.
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Dimension six and eight}
Our application of dimension six contributions is founded in \cite{Braaten1991}
and has previously been calculated beyond leading order by \cite{Lanin1986}. The
operators appearing are the masses to the power six \(m^6\), the four-quark
condensates \(\langle \anti q q \anti q q \rangle\), the three-gluon condensates
\(\langle g^3 G^3 \rangle\) and lower dimensional condensates multiplies by the
corresponding masses, such that in total the mass dimension of the operator will
be six. The largest contributions comes from the 4\-/quark operators. The
three\-/gluon condensate does not contribute at leading order
\cite{Hubschmid1982} and is neglected. Operators proportional to the light quark
masses will also be neglected. The resulting contribution of dimension six
operators has been calculated in \cite{Laning1986} and leads to a large amount
of operators, which until today cannot be accurately determined by phenomenology
methods. To reduce the number of operators the we can make use of the
\define{vsa}{vacuum saturation approach}
\cite{Beneke2008,Braaten1991,Shifman1978} to express them in quark condensates
\(\langle q \anti{q} \rangle\). For Wilson coefficients of order \(\alpha_s\)
and applying the vacuum saturation we get a dimension six contributions of
\begin{equation}
  \left. D_{ij,V/A}^{1+0}(s) \right\vert_{D=6} = \frac{32\pi^2}{3} a(\mu) \frac{\langle \anti{q}_iq_i(\mu) \rangle\langle \anti{q}_jq_j \rangle}{s^3}
  - \frac{32}{7} \pi^2 a_\mu \frac{\langle \anti{q}_i q_i \rangle^2 \langle \anti{q}_j q_j \rangle^2}{s^3}.
\end{equation}
Unfortunately the scaling properties of the dimension six contribution,
resulting from the \textsc{vsa}, are inconsistent with the scaling properties of
the 4\-/quark operators \cite{Narison1983,Jamin1985} and terms of order
\(\alpha_s^2\) are usually ignored. In addition to the scaling problematic the
\textsc{vsa} is known to underestimate the dimension six contribution
\cite{Launer1983}.

In our work we take the simplest approach possible: Introducing an effective
dimension six coefficient $\rho_{V/A}^{(6)}$ divided by the appropriate power in
s
\begin{equation}
  \left. D_{ij,V/A}^{(1+0)}(s) \right\rvert_{D=6} = 0.03 \frac{\rho_{V/A}^{(6)}}{s^3}
\end{equation}

As for the dimension eight contribution the situation is not better than the
dimension six one we keep the simplest approach, leading to
\begin{equation}
  \left. D_{ij,V/A}^{(1+0)} \right\rvert_{D=8} = 0.04 \frac{\rho_{V/A}^{(8)}}{s^4}.
\end{equation}

The \textsc{np} contribution of dimension eight is the highest order that we are
going to implement. Higher orders will be neglected. Next to the \textsc{np}
treatment of the \textsc{ope} we also have to discuss possible duality
violations.



\section{Duality Violations}
As seen in \cref{sec:duality} we have to assume quark\-/hadron duality for the
\textsc{qcdsr} to work. Unfortunately duality cannot always be taken for granted
and the existence of \define{dv}{duality violations} is a well known
\cite{Cata2008,Cata2009}. As we will see in the following section, the
experimental measured total tau decay ratio has a exponential decreasing,
sinusoidal contributions, that cannot be reproduced by the \textsc{ope} solely.
Consequently for the cases with apparent \textsc{dv} we also have to take into
account \textsc{dv} corrections and adapt \cref{eq:rTauContributions}
\begin{equation}
  R_{\tau,V/A}^\omega = \frac{N_c}{2}S_{EW} \abs{V_{ud}}^2 \left( 1 + \delta_{pt}^{\omega} + \delta_{npt}^{\omega} + \delta_{dv}^{\omega} \right).
\end{equation}
The \textsc{dv} correction has been modelled by a series of papers
\cite{Boito2011a,Boito2012,Boito2014} with the following ansatz 
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{V/A}^{DV}(s) = e^{-(\delta_{V/A}+\gamma_{V/A}s)} \sin(\alpha_{V/A} + \beta_{V/A}s),
\end{equation}
to parametrise the \textsc{dv} contributions. The \textsc{dv} would then appear
as an additional term in the inclusive tau decay ratio
\begin{equation}
  R_{\tau,V/A} = - \pi i \oint_{\abs{s}=m_\tau^2} \frac{\dif x}{x} (1 - x)^3 \left[ 3
    (1 + x) D^{(1+0)}(m_\tau^2 x) + 4 D^{(0)}(m_\tau^2 x) \right] +  \mathcal{D}_{V/A}(m_\tau^2),
\end{equation}
where the \textsc{dv} would be given as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}_\omega(m_\tau^2) = -12 \pi^2 \int_{m_\tau^2}^\infty \frac{\dif s}{m_\tau^2} \omega(s) \rho_{V/A}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pinched weights to avoid DVs}
\label{sec:pinchedWeights}
The general \textsc{qcdsr} (\cref{eq:qcdSumRules}) contain a weight function
\(\omega\), which is used to weight higher order dimensions, but also to
suppress \textsc{dv}. The weights that suppress \textsc{dv} are so\-/called
pinched weights of the form
\begin{equation}
  \omega(s) = \left(1-\frac{s}{m_\tau^2}\right)^k,
\end{equation}
where \(k\) is the degree of the pinched weight. The higher the degree the
farther we operate from the critical positive real axis (see.
\cref{fig:pinchedWeightGraphs}). The farther we are away the better we are
protected from the effects of \textsc{dv}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/monomialWeightGraphs.eps}
  \caption{Monomial weights $(1-s/m_\tau^2)^k$ for degrees $1\to4$. We can see
    that weights of higher pinching decrease faster, which comes in handy if we
    want to suppress duality violations.}
  \label{fig:monomialWeightGraphs}
\end{figure}
For the transversal component of the inclusive tau decay ratio
(\cref{eq:rTauT+L}) a pinching of second degree appears quite naturally as the
kinematic weight (see \cref{eq:kinematicWeight}).

In general it is said that a double pinched weight is sufficient to neglect
effects caused by duality violation.

Next to the pinched weights we focus on combinations of vector and
axial\-/vector contributions, which as we will see now suppress \textsc{dv}.



\section{Experiment}
The tau decay data we use to perform our \textsc{qcd} analysis is from the
\textsc{aleph} experiment. The \textsc{aleph} experiment was located at the
\define{lep}{large\-/electron\-/positron} collider at \define{cern}{European
  Organisation for Nuclear Research} in Geneva. \textsc{lep} started producing
particles in 1989 and was replaced in the late 90s by the
\define{lhc}{large\-/hadron\-/collider}, which makes use of the same tunnel of
\SI{27}{\kilo\meter} circumference. The data produced within the experiment is
still maintained by former \textsc{aleph} group members led by M. Davier,
which have performed regular updates on the data-sets
\cite{Davier2013,Davier2008,Aleph2005}.

The measured spectral functions for the \textsc{aleph} data are defined in
\cite{Davier2007} and given for the transverse and longitudinal components
separately
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \rho^{(1)}_{V/A}(s) &= \frac{m_\tau^2}{12 \abs{V_{ud}}^2S_{EW}} \frac{\mathcal{B}(\tau^- \to V^-/A^- \nu_\tau)}{\mathcal{B}(\tau^- \to e^- \anti{\nu}_e \nu_\tau)} \\
    &\quad\times \frac{\dif N_{V/A}}{N_{V/A}\dif s} \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^2 \left( 1 + \frac{2s}{m_\tau^2} \right) \right]^{-1} \\
    \rho^{(0)}_{A}(s) &= \frac{m_\tau^2}{12 \abs{V_{ud}}^2 S_{EW}}
    \frac{\mathcal{B}(\tau^- \to \pi^-(K^-) \nu_\tau)}{\mathcal{B}(\tau^- \to
      e^- \anti{\nu}_e \nu_\tau)} \times \frac{\dif N_A}{N_A \dif s} \left( 1 -
      \frac{s}{m_\tau^2} \right)^{-2}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The data relies on a separation into vector and axial-vector channels. In the
case of the pions this can be achieved via counting. The vector channel is
characterised by a negative parity, whereas the axial-vector channel has
positive parity. A quark has by definition positive parity, thus an anti-quark
has a negative parity. A meson, like the pion particle, is a composite particle
consisting of an quark an anti-quark. Consequently a single pion carries
negative parity, an even number of Pions carries positive parity and an odd
number of Pions carries negative parity:
\begin{equation}
  n \times \pi = \begin{cases} \mbox{vector} & \mbox{if } n \text{ is even}, \\ \mbox{axial-vector} & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}.
\end{equation}

The contributions to the spectral function for the vector, axial\-/vector and
V+A channel can be seen in \cref{fig:aleph}. The dominant modes in the vector
case are \cite{Davier2006} \(\tau^- \to \pi^-\pi^0 \nu_\tau\) and the \(\tau^-
\to \pi^- \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^0 \nu_\tau\). The first of these is produced by the
\(\rho(770)\) meson, which in contrary to the pions carries angular momentum of
one, which is also clearly visible as peak around \(\SI{770}{\giga\eV}\) in
\cref{fig:alephV}. The dominant modes in the axial-vector case are \(\tau^-\to
\pi^-\nu_\tau\), \(\tau^-\to \pi^- \pi^0 \pi^0 \nu_\tau\) and \(\tau^- \to \pi^-
\pi^- \pi^+\nu_\tau\). Here the three pion final states stem from the
\(a_1^-\)\-/meson, which is also clearly visible as a peak in \cref{fig:alephA}.

  \caption{Visualisation of the vector, axial\-/vector and V+A spectral function

    also plotted the \textsc{FOPT} theoretical calculation up to third order in
    \(\alpha_s\), for a fixed \(\alpha_s(\m_\tau)=0.329\) in blue. Note that the
    perturbative contribution can only limited represent the experimental data.
    It does not reproduce the sinusoidal form.}
  \label{fig:aleph}
\end{figure}

We furthermore added the perturbative result for a fixed
\(\alpha_s(m_\tau)=0.329\) using \textsc{fopt} in \cref{fig:alephVPlusA}. Here
we can see, that the perturbative result (the blue line) is an almost straight
line and cannot reproduce the sinusoidal graph, given by the \textsc{aleph}
data. This is especially the case for the \textsc{v} and \textsc{a} channel and
is seen as an indicator for \textsc{dv}. Even including \textsc{np}, higher
dimensions of the \textsc{ope} is not reproducing the wavy structure. In the
case of \textsc{v+a}, we have an higher agreement between our perturbative graph
and the data. In general we believe that \textsc{dv} are sufficiently suppressed
in the case of \textsc{v+a} and will argument in favour of this statement in the
following chapter. This is only the case for energies larger than
\SI{1.5}{\giga\eV}, as the \(\rho\) resonance of the \textsc{v} channel is
impossible to be represented by perturbative tools. For lower energies
\textsc{dv} become to important to be neglected.

\subsection{Total decay ratio from experimental data}
The data has been last revised in 2014 \cite{Davier2014} and is publicly
available \cite{AlephData}. It consists of the mass squared bin center
\textit{sbin}, the bin size \textit{dsbin}, the normalised invariant mass
squared distribution \textit{sfm2}, the total errors \textit{derr} and their
correlations \textit{corerr}. To make the data comparable to our theoretical
calculations we have to give the normalised invariant mass squared distribution
\textit{sfm2} in form of the total decay ratio \(R_\tau\). The data is given as
the normalised invariant mass squared distribution \((\dif N_i/\dif s)/N_i\)
scaled by a factor \(100\) and further normalised to the corresponding branching
ratio \(i\in\{\text{V,A,V+A}\}\). Thus we can connect the branching ratio of the
\(i\)\-/channel to \textit{sfm2} as follows
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}_{V/A} \equiv \int_0^{s_\tau} \dif s \frac{\sfm2_{V/A}(s)}{100}
  \equiv \int_0^{s_\tau} \dif s \mathcal{B}_{V/A}
  \left( \frac{\dif N_{V/A}}{N_{V/A}\dif s} \right)
\end{equation}
where we defined \(s_\tau \equiv m_\tau^2\). The total decay ratio \(R_\tau\) is
defined as the decay width of taus decaying into hadrons over taus decaying into
electrons and can be expressed via the corresponding branching ratios, which
then can be connected to the invariant mass squared distribution \(\sfm2\)
\begin{equation}
  R_{\tau, V/A} = \frac{\mathcal{B}_{V/A}}{\mathcal{B_e}}
  = \int_0^{s_\tau} \dif s \frac{\sfm2_{V/A}(s)}{100 \mathcal{B}_e}.
\end{equation}
Theoretically the decay ratio is given in \cref{eq:totalDecayRatio}. If we
neglect the longitudinal contribution \(\Ima \Pi^{(0)}(s)\) and remember the
definition of the spectral function (\cref{eq:spectralFunction}) and the
kinematic weight (\cref{eq:kinematicWeight}), we can write the decay ratio as
\begin{equation}
  R_{\tau, i} = \int_0^{s_\tau} \frac{dif s}{s_\tau} \omega_\tau(s) \rho(s)
\end{equation}
and thus relate the spectral function to the experimental data
\begin{equation}
  \rho(s) = \frac{s_\tau}{12 \pi^2 100 \mathcal{B}_e} \frac{\sfm2}{\omega_\tau}.
\end{equation}
To fit the experimental data we define a so\-/called \textit{spectral function
  moment} (or \textit{moment})
\begin{equation}
  I_{i}^{exp, \omega} \equiv \int_0^{s_0} \frac{\dif s}{s_0} \omega\left( \frac{s}{s_0} \right) \rho(s),
\end{equation}
which will be used in our \(\chi^2\) fits, explained in the upcoming section.
The data is given for discrete bins so we have to express the integral of the
spectral function moment as sum over those bins. The final expression we use to fit parameters to the experimental data is then
given by
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  I_{exp, V/A}^{\omega}(s_0) = \frac{s_\tau}{100 \mathcal{B}_e s_0}
  \sum_{i=1}^{N(s_0)} \frac{\omega\left( \frac{s_i}{s_0}
    \right)}{\omega_\tau\left( \frac{s_i}{s_\tau}\right)} \sfm2_{V/A}(s_i).
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{The Method of Least Squares}
We apply \define{ls}{method of least squares} to fit the parameters
\(\vec\alpha\) from the experimental data. We consequently construct a
\(\chi^2\)\-/function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ls}
  \chi^2 = \left( I_i^{exp} - I_i^{th}(\vec\alpha) \right) C^{exp}_{ij}^{-1} \left( I_j^{exp} - I_j^{th}(\vec\alpha) \right),
\end{equation}
where \(I^{exp}\)/ \(I^{th}\) is a vector of experimental moments/ theoretical
moments with the same weight, but different energy cutoffs \(s_0\), labelled by
the index \(i\). In addition \(C^{exp}\) is the covariance matrix describing the
correlation of the different experimental moments
\(C_{ij}^{exp}=cov[I_i^{exp}I_j^{exp}]\), which is given by the \textsc{aleph} data.

In general we aim to minimise the value of \(\chi^2\), which will fix the
parameter vector \(\vec\alpha\). The properties of the \(\chi^2\)\-/function are
well known and the best fits are characterised through \(\chi^2/dof\approx 1\),
where the \textsc{dof} of the fit can be calculated through
\begin{equation}
  \text{#\textsc{dof}} = \text{#experimental moments} - \text{#parameters}.
\end{equation}
E.g. if we want to fit \(\alpha_s\) and the dimension four Wilson coefficient
\(C_4\) we get \(7-2=5\) \textsc{dof}.

The parameter vector \(\vec\alpha\) includes the strong coupling \(\alpha_s\),
but also the included \textsc{ope} Wilson coefficient. Consequently we should
have at least as many, if not more moments as parameters we want to fit. As the
moments for different \(s_0\) are highly correlated we are limited to fit a set of
only a few parameters.

It is also possible to increase the number of moments used by using multiple
weights \(\omega\). Unfortunately using different weights leads to highly
correlated moments, which leads to numerical complications by inverting the
covariance matrix in \cref{eq:ls}. To handle the high correlations we have to
redefine our fit quality.


\subsection{Block Diagonal ``Fit\-/Quality''}
Following \cite{Boito2014} we can redefine \textsc{ls} to
\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  Q^2 = \sum_{\omega} \sum_{s_0^i,s_0^j} \left(I_{\omega}^{exp}(s_0^i) -
    I_{\omega}^{th}(s_0^i,\vec\alpha)\right) \widetilde{C}_{ij,\omega}^{-1}
  \left(I_{\omega}^{exp}(s_0^j) - I_{\omega}^{th}(s_0^j,\vec\alpha)\right),
\end{tcolorbox}
where the covariance matrix \(\widetilde{C}\) is now a diagonal of the experimental covariance
matrices \(C_{\omega}^{exp}\) for each weight
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde{C} = \begin{pmatrix}
    C_{\omega=1}^{exp} & 0           & \dots  & 0      \\
    0           & C_{\omega=2}^{exp} & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \vdots      & \ddots      & \ddots & 0      \\
    0           & \dots       & 0      & C_{\omega=n}^{exp}
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
As a result we are still able to invert the newly defined covariance matrix
\(\widetilde{C}\), but minimisation routines like \textsc{CERN} \textsc{minuit}
are now able to calculate the proper errors for the parameters we want to
extract. We have to perform our own error propagation to obtain meaningful
errors for the parameters.


\subsubsection{Error Propagation}
The error propagation has been derived in \cite{Boito2011a,Boito2011} and is given as
\begin{equation}
  \langle \delta \alpha_k \alpha_l \rangle = A_{km}^{-1}A_{ln}^{-1}
  \pd{I_i^{th}(\vec\alpha)}{\alpha_m} \pd{I_r^{th}(\vec \alpha)}{\alpha_n}
  \widetilde{C}_{ij}^{-1} \widetilde{C}_{ij}^{-1} \langle \delta I_k^{exp} \delta I_l^{exp} \rangle,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  A_{kl} = \pd{I^{th}(\vec\alpha)}{\alpha_k} \widetile{C}_{ij}^{-1} \frac{I^{th}_j(\vec\alpha)}{\alpha_l}.
\end{equation}
