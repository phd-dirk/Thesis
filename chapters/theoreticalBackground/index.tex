\chapter{QCD Sum Rules}
\label{ch:theoreticalBackground}
It is most remarkably that we can describe the properties of quarks and gluons
via a local \textsc{qft} based on the gauge group $SU(3)$. However \textsc{qcd}
only applies to coloured particles and not to colourless particles like hadrons.
Due to confinement we can only ever observe hadrons, but our theoretical
foundation is ruled by the \textsc{dof} of quarks and gluons. To extract
\textsc{qcd}\-/parameters (the six quark\-/masses and the strong\-/coupling)
from hadrons we need bridge the quark-gluon\-/ with the hadron\-/picture. To do so we will introduce the
theory of \textsc{qcdsr}. Starting with \textsc{qcd} we will discuss the
\textsc{qcd}\-/Lagrangian. \textsc{qcd} is describing the quark\-/gluon picture
solely and ruled by the abelian gauge group $SU(3)$, which has important
implications on the running of the strong coupling and the applicability of
\textsc{pt}. Next we will focus on the two\-/point function, which is the main
physical object we are going to study within the \textsc{qcdsr}. It is
vacuum\-/expectation values of quark currents. We can theoretically describe the
processes, like $\tau$\-/decays into hadrons, by choosing currents with
matching quantum numbers to the outgoing particles. We will see, that the
two\-/point function $\Pi(q^2)$ is related to hadronic states, by poles for $q^2
> 0$. Here \textsc{np}\-/effects become important and we need to introduce the
\textsc{ope}, which handles \textsc{np}\-/effects as \textsc{qcd}\-/condensates. These
condensates are remainders of the \textsc{qcd}\-/vacuum $\Omega_{QCD}$. In
contrast to $\textsc{qed}$ normal ordered products of fields do not vanish, but
remain as parameters and have to be phenomenological fitted or calculated by other
\textsc{np} tools, like \textsc{lqcd}.  \textcolor{red}{...}

\section{Quantum\-/chromodynamics}
\label{sec:quantumchromodynamics}
Since the formulation of \textsc{qed} in the end of the 40's it has been
attempted to describe the strong nuclear force as a \textsc{qft}, which has been
achieved in the 70's as \textsc{qcd}
\cite{GellMann1972,Fritzsch1973,Gross1973,Politzer1973,Weinberg1973}.
\textsc{qcd} is a renormalisable \textsc{qft} of the strong interaction, which
fundamental fields are given by dirac spinors of spin\-/$1/2$, the so\-/called
quarks, with a fractional electric charge of $\pm 1/3$ or $\pm 2/3$. The theory
furthermore contains gauge\-/fields of spin 1, which are chargeless, massless
and referred to as gluons. The gluons are the force\-/mediators, which interact
with quarks and themselves, in contrast to photons of \textsc{qed}, which
interact only with fermions (see \cref{fig:qcdFeynmanDiagrams}).

The corresponding gauge\-/group of \textsc{qcd} is the non\-/abelian group
$SU(3)$. Each of the quark flavours $u,d,c,s,t$ and $b$ belongs to the
fundamental representation of $SU(3)$ and contains a triplet of fields $\Psi$.
\begin{equation}
  \Psi = \begin{pmatrix} \Psi_1 \\ \Psi_2 \\ \Psi_3 \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix} \textcolor{red}{red} \\ \textcolor{green}{green} \\ \textcolor{blue}{blue} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The components of the triplet are the so\-/called colours\footnote{The colour
  denomination is not gauge\-/invariant. After a colour gauge transformation the
  new colours are a linear combination of the old colours, which breaks
  gauge\-/symmetry.} red, green and blue, which is referred to as
\textit{colour\-/charge}. The gluons belong to the adjoint representation of
$SU(3)$, contain an octet of fields and can be expressed using the Gell-Mann
matrices $\lambda_a$
\begin{equation}
  B_\mu = B_\mu^a \lambda_a \qquad a = 1,2,\dotsc 8
\end{equation}

The classical \textit{Lagrange density} of \textsc{qcd} is given by
\cite{Jamin2006,Pascual1984}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcdLagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_{QCD}(x) = -\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^a(x)G^{\mu\nu a}(x) + \sum_A \left[ \frac{i}{2} \bar{q}^A(x) \gamma^\mu \overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu q^A(x) - m_A\bar{q}^A(x) a^A(x) \right],
\end{equation}
with $q^A(x)$ representing the quark fields and $G_{\mu\nu}^a$ being the
\textit{gluon field strength tensor} given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gluonField}
  G_{\mu\nu}^a(x) \equiv \partial_\mu B_\nu^a(x) - \partial_\nu^a(x) + g f^{abc} B_\mu^b(x) B_\nu^c(x),
\end{equation}
with $f^{abc}$ as \textit{structure constants} of the gauge\-/group $SU(3)$ and
$overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu$ as covariant derivative acting to the left and to
the right. Furthermore we have used $A, B, \dotsc = 0, \dotsc 5$ as flavour
indices, $a, b, \dotsc = 0, \dotsc, 8 $ as colour indices and $\mu, \nu, \dotsc
= 0, \dotsc 3$ as lorentz indices. Explicitly the Lagrangian writes:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L}_0(x) &=- \frac{1}{4} \left[ \partial_\mu G_\nu^a(x) - \partial_v G_\mu^a(x) \right] \left[ \partial^\mu G_a^\nu(x) - \partial^\nu G^\mu_a(x) \right] \\
    &\quad+ \frac{i}{2}\anti{q}_\alpha^A(x) \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu q_\alpha^A(x) - \frac{i}{2} \left[ \partial_\mu \anti{q}_\alpha^A(x) \right] \gamma^\mu q_\alpha^A(x) - m_A \anti{q}_\alpha^A(x) q_\alpha^A(x) \\
    &\quad+ \frac{g_s}{2} \anti{q}_\alpha^A(x) \lambda^a_{\alpha \beta}\gamma_\mu q_\beta^A(x) G^\mu_a(x) \\
    &\quad- \frac{g_s}{2}f_{abc}\left[ \partial_\mu G_\nu^a(x) - \partial_\nu G_\mu^a(x)\right] G_b^\mu(x) G_c^\nu(x) \\
    &\quad- \frac{g_s^2}{4} f_{abc}f_{ade} G_\mu^b(x) G_\nu^c(x) G_d^\mu(x)
    G_e^\nu(x)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The first term is the kinetic term for the massless gluons. The next three terms
are the kinetic terms for the quark field with different masses for each
flavour. The rest of the terms are the interaction terms. The fifth term
represents the interaction between quarks and gluons and the last two terms the
self\-/interactions of gluon fields.

Having derived the Lagrangian leaves us with its quantisation. The
dirac\-/spinors can be quantised as in \textsc{qed} without any problems. The
$\Psi(x)$ quantum field can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \Psi(x) = \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2\pi)^3 2E(\vec p)} \sum_\lambda \left[ u(\vec p, \lambda) a(\vec p, \lambda) e^{-ipx} + v(\vec p, \lambda) b^\dagger (\vec p, \lambda) e^{ipx} \right],
\end{equation}
where the integration ranges over the positive sheet of the mass hyperboloid
$\Omega_+(m) = \{p \vert p^2 = m^2, p^0 > 0 \}$. The four spinors $u(\vec p,
\lambda)$ and $v(\vec p, \lambda)$ are solutions to the dirac equations in
momentum space
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    [\slashed p - m]u(\vec p, \lambda) &= 0 \\
    [\slashed p + m]v(\vec p, \lambda) &= 0,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda$ representing the helicity state of the spinors.

The quantisation of the gauge\-/fields are more cumbersome. One is forced to
introduce supplementary non\-/physical fields, the so\-/called Faddeev\-/Popov
ghosts $c^a(x)$ \cite{Faddeev1967}.

The free propagators for the quark\-/, the gluon\-/ and the ghost\-/fields are
then given by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    i S^{(0)AB}_{\alpha\beta}(x-y) &\equiv \wick{ \c q_\alpha^A(x) \anti{\c
        q}_\beta^B(y)} \equiv \langle 0 \vert T \{ q_\alpha^A(x)
    \anti{q}_\beta^B \} \vert 0 \rangle
    = \delta_{AB} \delta_{\alpha\beta} i S^{(0)}(x-y) \\
    &= i \delta_{AB}\delta_{\alpha\beta}\int \fdif{p} \frac{\slashed p + m}{(p^2 - m^2 + i\epsilon)}\\
    i D^{(0)\mu\nu}_{ab}(x-y) &\equiv \wick{ \c B_a^\mu(x) \c B_b^\nu(y)} \equiv
    \langle 0 \vert T \{ B_a^\mu(x) B_b^\nu(y) \} \vert 0 \rangle
    \equiv \delta_{ab}i \int \frac{\dif^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} D^{(0)\mu\nu}(k) e^{-ik(x-y)} \\
    &= i \delta_{ab} \int \frac{\dif^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{1}{k^2+i\epsilon} \left[ -g_{\mu\nu} + (1-a) \frac{k_\mu k_\nu}{k^2+i\epsilon} \right] e^{-ik(x-y)} \\
    i \widetilde{D}_{ab}^{(0)}(x-y) & \equiv \wick{\c \phi_a(x) \anti{\c
        \phi}_b(y)} \equiv \langle 0 \vert T\{ \phi_a(x) \anti{\phi}_b(y) \}
    \vert 0 \rangle
    = \frac{i}{(2\pi)^4}\delta_{ab} \int \dif^4 q \frac{-1}{q^2 + i\epsilon} e^{-q(x-y)} \\
    &\equiv \frac{i}{(2\pi)^4} \delta_{ab} \int \dif^4 q \widetilde{D}^{(0)}(q)
    e^{-iq(x-y)},
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding Feynman\-/rules have been displayed in
\cref{fig:qcdFeynmanRules}.

\subsection{Renormalisation Group}
The perturbations of the QCD Lagrangian in \cref{eq:qcdLagrangian} lead to
divergencies, which have to be \textit{renormalised}. Making these divergencies
finite is referred to as \textit{regularisation} and there are various
approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item \label{itm:lambdaRegularisation}\textbf{$\bm{\lambda}$ regularisation:} In $Lambda$ regularisation we
  limit the divergent momentum integrals by a cutoff $\abs{\vec p} < \Lambda$.
  Here $\Lambda$ has the dimension of mass. In \textsc{qcd} $\Lambda$ marks the
  separation between short\-/ and long\-/distance effects. For momenta smaller
  than the cutoff ($\abs{\vec p} < \Lambda$) we probe short\-/distances. On the
  contrary for large momenta $\abs{\vec p} > \Lambda$ we have to include
  long\-/distance effects. We will see that we can make use of \textsc{pt} only
  for high\-/momenta (short\-/distances). The cutoff regularisation breaks
  translational invariance, which can be guarded by making use of other
  regularisation methods.
\item \textbf{\define{Pauli-Villars}{P-I} regularisation:} \cite{Pauli1949} In
  \textsc{P-I} regularisation the propagator is forced to decrease faster than
  the divergence to appear. It replaces the nominator by
  \begin{equation}
    (\vec p^2 + m^2)^{-1} \to (\vec p^2 + m^2)^{-1} - (\vec p^2 + M^2)^{-1},
  \end{equation}
  where $M$ has the dimension acts similar as the previously presented cutoff,
  but conserves translational invariance.
\item \textbf{Dimensional regularisation:}
  \cite{Bollini1972,tHooft1972,tHooft1973} Dimensional regularisation has been
  introduced in the beginning of the seventies to regularise non\-/abelian gauge
  theories (like \textsc{qcd}), where $\Lambda$\-/ and
  \textsc{P-V}\-/regularisation failed. In dimensional regularisation we expand
  the four space\-/time dimensions to arbitrary $D$-dimensions. To compensate
  for the additional dimensions we introduce an additional scale $\mu^{D-4}$. A
  typical Feynman\-/integral then has the following appearance:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dimRegFeynmanIntegral}
    \int \fdif{p} \frac{1}{\vec p^2 + m^2} \to \mu^{2\epsilon} \int \frac{\dif^D p}{(2\pi)^D}\frac{1}{\vec p^2+m^2},
  \end{equation}
  Dimensional regularisation preserves all symmetries, it allows an easy
  identification of divergences and naturally leads to the \define{ms}{minimal
    subtraction scheme} \cite{tHooft1973,Weinberg1973a}.
\end{itemize}
In all of the three regularisation schemes we introduced an arbitrary parameter
to regularise the divergence. This parameter causes an scale dependence of the
strong coupling and the quark masses. As we are mainly concerned with the
non\-/abelian gauge theory \textsc{qcd} we will focus on dimensional
regularisation, which introduced the parameter $\mu$. Measurable observables
(\textit{Physical quantities}) cannot depend on the renormalisation scale $\mu$.
In the Therefore the derivative by $\mu$ of a general
physical quantity has to yield zero. The physical quantity $R(q, a_s, m)$, that
depends on the external momentum q, the renormalised coupling
$a_s\equiv\alpha_s/\pi$ and the renormalised quark mass $m$ can then be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:RGE}
  \mu \od{}{\mu}R(q, a_s, m) = \left[ \mu \pd{}{\mu} + \mu \od{a_s}{\mu} \pd{}{m} + \mu \od{m}{\mu} \pd{}{m} \right] R(q, a_s, m) = 0.
\end{equation}
\Cref{eq:RGE} is referred to as \textbf{renormalisation group equation} and is
the basis for defining the two \textit{renormalisation group functions}:
\begin{align}
  \beta(a_s) &\equiv -\mu \od{a_s}{\mu} = \beta_1 a_s^2 + \beta_2 a_s^3 + \dots & \beta-\text{function}
                                                                                  \label{eq:betaFunction} \\
  \gamma(a_s) &\equiv - \frac{\mu}{m} \od{m}{\mu} = \gamma_1 a_s + \gamma_2 a_s^2 + \dots & \text{anomalous mass dimension}.
                                                                                            \label{eq:anomalousMassDimension}
\end{align}
The coefficients of the $\beta$-function and the mass anomalous dimension are
currently known up to the 5\textsuperscript{th} order and listed in the appendix
\ref{sec:betaCoefficients}.

\subsubsection{Running gauge coupling}
The $\beta$-function and the anomalous mass dimension are responsible for the
running of the strong coupling and the running of the quark mass respectively.
In this section we will shortly review the $\beta$-function and its implications
on the strong coupling, whereas in the following section we will discuss the
anomalous-mass dimension.

Regarding the $\beta$-function we notice, that $a_s(\mu)$ is not a constant, but
\textit{runs} by varying its scale $\mu$. Lets observe the running of the strong
coupling constant by integrating the $\beta$-function
\begin{equation}
  \int_{a_s(\mu_1)}^{a_s(\mu_2)}\frac{\dif a_s}{\beta(a_s)} = - \int_{\mu_1}^{\mu_2} \frac{\dif \mu}{\mu} = \log \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}.
\end{equation}
To analytically evaluate the above integral we can approximate the
$\beta$-function to first order, with the known coefficient
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:firstBetaCoefficient}
  \beta_1 = \frac{1}{6}(11 N_c - 2 N_f),
\end{equation}
yielding
\begin{equation}
  a_s(\mu_2) = \frac{a_s(\mu_1)}{\left( 1 - a_s(\mu_1) \beta_1 \log\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2} \right)}.
\end{equation}
As we have three colours ($N_c=3$) and six flavours ($N_f=6$) the first
$\beta$-function \ref{eq:betaFunction} is positive. Thus for $\mu_2>\mu_1$
$a_s(\mu_2)$ decreases logarithmically and vanishes for $\mu_2 \to \infty$. This
behaviour is known as \textit{asymptotic freedom} and leads to
\textit{confinement}.

Asymptotic freedom states, that for high energies (small distances), the strong
coupling becomes diminishing small and quarks and gluons do not interact. Thus
in isolated baryons and mesons the quarks are separated by small distances, move
freely and do not interact. On the other hand we are not able to separate the
quarks in a meson or baryon. No quark has been detected as single particle yet.
This is qualitatively explained with the gluon field carrying colour charge.
These gluons form so-called \textit{flux-tubes} between quarks, which cause a
constant strong force between particles regardless of their separation.
Consequently the energy needed to separate quarks is proportional to the
distance between them and at some point there is enough energy to favour the
creation of a new quark pair. Thus before separating two quarks we create a
quark\-/antiquark pair. As a result we will probably never be able to observe an
isolated quark. This phenomenon is referred to as colour confinement or simply
confinement.

\subsubsection{Running quark mass}
Not only the coupling but also the masses carry an energy dependencies, which is
governed by the \textit{anomalous mass dimension} $\gamma(a_s)$.

The properties of the running quark mass can be derived similar to the gauge
coupling. Starting from integrating the \textit{anomalous mass dimension}
\cref{eq:anomalousMassDimension}
\begin{equation}
  \log \frac{m(\mu_2)}{m(\mu_1)} = \int_{a_s(\mu_1)}^{a_s(\mu_2)} \dif a_s \frac{\gamma(a_s)}{\beta(a_s)}
\end{equation}
we can approximate the \textit{anomalous mass dimension} to first order and
solve the integral analytically \cite{Schwab2002}
\begin{equation}
  m(\mu_2) = m(\mu_1)\left( \frac{a(\mu_2)}{a(\mu_1)} \right)^{\frac{\gamma_1}{\beta_1}} \left( 1 + \mathcal{O}(\beta_2, \gamma_2) \right).
\end{equation}
As $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ (see \ref{app:gammaCoefficients}) are positive the
quark mass decreases with increasing $\mu$. The general relation between
different scales is given by
\begin{equation}
  m(\mu_2) = m(\mu_1) \exp \left( \int_{a_s(\mu_1)}^{a_s(\mu_2)} \dif a_s \frac{\gamma(a_s)}{\beta(a_s)}  \right)
\end{equation}
and can be solved numerically to run the quark mass to the needed scale $\mu_2$.

\textsc{qcd} in general has a precision problem caused by uncertainties and
largeness of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The fine-structure
constant (the coupling \textsc{qed}) is known to eleven digits, whereas the
strong coupling is only known to about four. Furthermore for low energies the
strong coupling constant is much larger than the fine-structure constant. E.g.
at the $Z$-mass, the standard mass to compare the strong coupling, we have an
$\alpha_s$ of $0.11$, whereas the fine structure constant would be around
$0.007$. Consequently to use \textsc{pt} we have to calculate our results to
much higher orders, including tens of thousands of Feynman diagrams, in
\textsc{qcd} to achieve a precision equal to \textsc{qed}. For even lower
energies, around \SI{1}{\giga\eV}, the strong coupling reaches a critical value
of $\approx 0.5$ leading to a break down of \textsc{pt}.

In this work we try to achieve a higher precision in the value of $\alpha_s$.
The framework we use to measure the strong coupling constant are the
\textsc{qcdsr}. A central object needed to describe hadronic states with the
help of \textsc{qcd} is the \textit{two-point function} for which we will devote the
following section.

\section{Two-Point function}
\label{sec:twoPointFunction}
A lot of particle physics is dedicated of calculating the \textit{S\-/matrix}, which
contains all the information about how initial states evolve in time. One
important tool for obtaining the S\-/matrix is the \textit{LSZ (Lehmann\-/Symanzik\-/Zimmermann)-reduction
  formula} \cite{Lehmann1954a,Schwartz2013}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle f\vert S \vert i\rangle =
    \left[ i\int_0^\infty \fdif{x_1} e^{-ip_1x_1} (\Box^2 + m^2)\right] \cdots
    \left[ i\int_0^\infty \fdif{x_n} e^{ip_nx_n} (\Box^2 + m^2)\right] \\
    \times \langle\Omega\vert T\{\phi(x_1)\cdots\phi(x_n)\} \vert\Omega\rangle,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with the $-i$ in the exponent applying for initial states and the $+i$ for final
states. The LSZ\-/reduction formula relates the S\-/matrix to the \textit{correlator} (also referred to as
\textit{n\-/point function})
\begin{equation}
  \langle\Omega\vert T\{\phi(x_1)\phi(x_2)\cdots\phi(x_n)\} \vert\Omega\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $T\{\cdots\}$ is the time\-/ordered product and $\vert\Omega\rangle$
is the ground state/ vacuum of the interacting theory. Note that the fields are in
general given in the Heisenberg picture, which implies translational invariance.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle\Omega\vert \phi(x)\phi(y) \vert\Omega\rangle &= \langle\Omega\vert \phi(x) e^{i\hat P y}e^{-i\hat P y}\phi(y)e^{i\hat P y}e^{-i\hat P y} \vert\Omega\rangle \\
    &= \langle\Omega\vert \phi(x-y)\phi(0) \vert\Omega\rangle,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we made use of the translation operator $\hat T(x) = e^{-i \hat P x}$.

In this work we are concerned about the \textit{two\-/point function}.
We are especially interested in the vacuum expectation value of $2$ time\-/ordered \textsc{qcd} quark Noether\-/currents
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcdCorrelator}
  \Pi_{\mu\nu}(q^2) \equiv \int \fdif{q} e^{iqx} \langle\Omega\vert J_\mu(x)J_\nu(0) \vert\Omega\rangle,
\end{equation}
where the Noether current $J_\mu(x)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcdCurrent}
  J_\mu(x) = \anti{q}(x) \Gamma q(x).
\end{equation}
Here, $\Gamma$ can be any of the following dirac matrices $\Gamma \in \{ 1,
i\gamma_5, \gamma_\mu, \gamma_\mu\gamma_5\}$, specifying the quantum number of
the current (S: \textit{scalar}, P: \textit{pseudo-Scalar}, V:
\textit{vectorial}, A: \textit{axial-vectorial}, respectively). By choosing the
right quantum numbers we can theoretically represent the processes we want to
study.

  \caption{$e^+e^-$\-/scattering with a quark\-/antiquark pair.}
  \label{fig:electronElectronScattering}
\end{wrapfigure}
From a Feynman diagram point of view we can illustrate the two\-/point function
as quark\-/antiquark pair, which is produced by an external source, e.g. the
virtual photon of electron\-/electron elastic scattering as seen in \cref{fig:electronElectronScattering}.
Here the quarks are propagating at \textit{short\-/distances}, which implies
that we can make use of \textsc{pt}, thus avoiding \textit{long\-/distance} 
(\textsc{npt}\-/) effects, that would appear if the initial and final states
where given by hadrons \cite{Colangelo2000}. 

\subsection{Short\-/Distances vs. Long\-/Distances}
If we want to calculate the two\-/point function in \textsc{qcd} we have to
differentiate short\-/ and long\-/distances or large or small momenta. In
general when we talk about small distances we refer to large momenta. Large
momenta implies a small strong coupling constant. Consequently we can use
\textsc{pt} for short\-/distances. On the contrary long distances involve small
momenta, which implies a large coupling constant. Thus for long distances the
perturbation theory has broken down and cannot be used. We can make use of
\(\Lambda\)\-/regularisation (\cref{itm:lambdaRegularisation}) to define the
differentiation of short\-/ and long\-/distances. Thus for \(q <
\Lambda\)\footnote{$\Lambda$ is a momentum\-/cutoff, so we have to compare
  momenta and not distances.} we have short\-/distances and for \(q > \Lambda\)
we have long\-/distances. In our case we need the quark\-/antiquark pair of
\cref{fig:electronElectronScattering} to be highly virtual \footnote{Which is
  the same of saying, that the quark\-/antiquark pair needs a high external
  momentum \(q\).}. To separate long\-/distances from short\-/distances using a
length scale we can say that the length scale should be smaller than the radius
of a hadron. 

\subsection{Relating Two\-/Point Function and Hadrons}
The correlator \cref{eq:qcdCorrelator} describes the interactions of the
fundamental \textsc{dof} of \textsc{qcd}, namely the quarks and gluons, but we
can also relate the correlator to hadrons. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[ams equation,myformula]
  x = y
\end{tcolorbox} 


Here $\vert \Omega \rangle$ is the physical vacuum and the fields operators
$\phi(x)$ and $\phi(y)$ are time dependent Heisenberg operators, which can be
translated to its origin. The two\-/point function can be interpreted physically
as the amplitude of propagating single\-/ or multi\-/particles and their
excitations. The correlator can be expressed as a \textit{spectral
  decomposition}, which has been discovered early on by
\cite{Kallen1952,Lehmann1954} and is named \textit{Källén-Lehmann spectral
  representation}. This spectral representation is interesting to us for two
main reasons. First it is experimentally measurable and second it carries a
problematic ``branch cut'', which we want to discuss now.

\subsection{Källén-Lehmann spectral representation}
In the second quantisation we applied latter operators $a_o^\dagger$ on the free
vacuum $\vert 0 \rangle$ to obtain single particle states, carrying a momentum
$p$
\begin{equation}
  a_p^\dagger \vert 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 E_p}}\vert \vec p \rangle,
\end{equation}
where the factor $\sqrt{2 E_p}$ is a convention resulting from the harmonic
oscillator. The identity operator for one\-/particle state, which selects only
single particle states is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{1} = \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{2\omega_p} \vert \vec p \rangle \langle \vec p \vert.
\end{equation}
The above complete set of one\-/particle states can be enhanced to include
multiple\-/particle states, where we have to sum not only over all possible
momentum states $\vert \vec p \rangle$, but over all possible multi\-/particle
states and their enhanced states as well. If we define these state vectors as
$\vec X$ we can express the complete set of one\-/ and multiple\-/particle
states as
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{1} = \intsum_{X} \dif \prod_X \vert X \rangle \langle  X \vert,
\end{equation}
where we have to sum over all possible $\vert X \rangle$ single- or
multi\-/particle states and integrate over the momentum $\vec p$ via
\begin{equation}
  \dif \Pi_X \equiv \prod_{i \in X} \int \frac{\dif^3 p_i}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{2 E_j}.
\end{equation}
To get to the desired spectral decomposition we have to translate the Heisenberg
operator $\phi(x)$ to its origin, like
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle \Omega \vert \phi(x) \vert X \rangle
    &=  \langle \Omega \vert e^{i \hat P x}e^{-i \hat P x} \phi(x) e^{i \hat P x}e^{-i \hat P x} \vert X \rangle \\
    &= e^{-i p_X x} \langle \Omega \vert e^{-i \hat P x} \phi(x) e^{i \hat P x} \vert X \rangle \\
    &= e^{-i p_X x} \langle \Omega \vert \phi(0) \vert X \rangle.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Equally we can we can express $\phi(y)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \langle X \vert \phi(y) \vert \Omega \rangle = e^{ipy} \langle \Omega \vert \phi(0) \vert \Omega \rangle.
\end{equation}
With these expressions in hand we can spectral decompose the two\-/point
function (\cref{eq:simpleTwoPointFunction})
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle \Omega \vert \phi(x) \phi(y) \vert 0 \rangle
    &= \intsum_X \dif \Pi_X \langle \Omega \vert \phi(x) \vert X \rangle \langle X \vert \phi(y) \vert \Omega \rangle \\
    &= \intsum_X \dif \Pi_X e^{-i p_X (x-y)} \abs{\langle \Omega \vert \phi(0) \vert X \rangle}^2  \\
    &= \int \frac{\dif^4 p}{(2\pi)^4} e^{-i p (x-y)} (2\pi)^3 \left[ \intsum_X
      \dif \Pi_X 2\pi \delta^{(4)}(p-p_X) \abs{\langle \Omega \vert \phi(0)
        \vert X \rangle}^2 \right],
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the term in the bracket is Lorentz invariant, implying that it depends
only on the Lorentz\-/invariant measure $p^2$. The multi\-/particle states
$\vert X \rangle$ have to have positive energy eigenstates $p^0 > 0$.
Consequently we can define the \textit{spectral function} as
\begin{equation}
  \theta(p^0) \rho(p^2) \equiv \intsum_X \dif \Pi_X  2\pi \delta^{(4)}(p-p_X) \abs{\langle \Omega \vert \phi(0) \vert X \rangle}^2,
\end{equation}
with $\rho(p^2)$ being the \textit{spectral density}. The simple two\-/point
function (\cref{eq:simpleTwoPointFunction}) can then be rewritten to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle \Omega \vert \phi(x) \phi(y) \vert \Omega \rangle &= \int \fdif{p} e^{-i p(x-y)} \theta(p^0) \rho(p^2) \\
    &= \int_0^\infty \dif q^2 \rho(q^2) D(x, y, q^2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    D(x,y,m^2) &= \int \frac{\dif^3}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{2E_p} e^{-i p (x-y)} \\
    &= \int \frac{\dif^4 p}{(2\pi)^3} e^{-i p (x-y)} \theta(p_0) \delta(p^2 -
    m^2).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$\rho(p^2)$ \textit{spectral density}, $\rho(p^2) > 0$. The spectral function is
a non\-/negative function, describing physically measurable particle states.
Until now we have given the spectral function for our ``simple'' two\-/point
function (\cref{eq:simpleTwoPointFunction}), but we can generalise the
decomposition to the \define{FT}{Fourier transform} of the
\textit{time\-/ordered two\-/point function}
\begin{equation}
  \Pi(p^2) = i\int\fdif{x} e^{-ixp}\langle\Omega\vert T\{\phi(x)\phi(0) \} \vert\Omega\rangle,
\end{equation}
where we made use of the translation invariance of the correlator\footnote{
  $\langle\Omega\vert\phi(x)\phi(y)\vert\Omega\rangle = \langle\Omega\vert
  e^{i\hat P y}\underbrace{e^{-i\hat P y}\phi(x)e^{i\hat P
      y}}_{x-y}\underbrace{e^{-i\hat P y}\phi(y)e^{i \hat P y}}_{=\phi(0)}e^{-i
    \hat P y} \vert\Omega\rangle =
  \langle\Omega\vert\phi(x-y)\phi(0)\vert\Omega\rangle$}. The time\-/ordered
scalar correlator can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \
  \begin{split}
    \Pi(p^2)
    &= i\int\fdif{x}e^{-ixp}\left[\theta(x^0-0) \langle\Omega\vert T\{ \phi(x)\phi(0) \} \vert\Omega\rangle + \theta(y^0-0)\langle\Omega\vert T\{ \phi(x)\phi(0) \} \vert\Omega\rangle\right]  \\
    &= i\int\fdif{x}e^{-ixp}\int_0^\infty \dif q^2\, \rho(q^2) \left[ \theta(x^0-0)D(x,0,q^2) + \theta(y^0-0)D(0,x,q^2) \right] \\
    &= i\int\fdif{x}e^{-ixp}\int_0^\infty \dif q^2\, \rho(q^2) \int\fdif{p}
    \frac{i}{p^2 - q^2 - i\epsilon}e^{ipx}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
by making use of the mathematical identity\footnote{The identity should be known
  to the reader from the derivation of the Feynman propagator.}
\begin{equation}
  \theta(x^0-y^0)D(x,y,q^2) + \theta(y^0-x^0)D(y,x,q^2) = \int \fdif{p} \frac{i}{p^2-q^2-i\epsilon}e^{ip(x-y)}.
\end{equation}
The last line of is given by two cancelling Fourier transforms. Thus we
recognise the Källén-Lehmann spectral decomposition of the scalar time\-/ordered
two\-/point function
\begin{equation}
  \Pi(p^2) = \int_0^\infty \dif q^2 \frac{i\rho(q^2)}{p^2-q^2-i\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
Also notice that when applying the following mathematical identity
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cuttingRules}
  \Ima \frac{1}{p^2-q^2+i\epsilon} = -\pi \delta(p^2-q^2)
\end{equation}
that the spectral function can be given by the imaginary part of the correlator
\begin{equation}
  \rho(p^2) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \Ima\Pi(p^2).
\end{equation}
The spectral function usually has a pole at one\-/particle states and a branch
cut above the multi\-/particle state threshold. The branch cut is of high
importance to us as the experimental detected spectral function is only
accessible at the possible real axis, where the branch cut exists. We will
further study these singularities with the following example of a
toy\-/Lagrangian of two interacting scalar fields.

\subsection{Analytic Structure of the Spectral Function}
To analyse the singularities contained in the spectral function $\rho(s)$ we
have a look at the following Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} \phi(\partial_\mu \partial^\mu + M^2) \phi - \frac{1}{2}\pi(\partial_\mu\partial^\mu + M^2)\pi + \frac{\lambda}{2}{\phi\pi^2}.
\end{equation}
The Lagrangian contains two fields $\phi$ and $\pi$, which interact via the
interaction term $\lambda/2 \phi \pi^2$. We now want to calculate the
self\-/interaction of the $\phi$\-/field, as shown in
\cref{fig:twoPointFunctionSelfEnergy}, to first order.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/twoPointFunctionSelfEnergy}
  \caption{Self energy}
  \label{fig:twoPointFunctionSelfEnergy}
\end{figure}
To do so we need an expression for the free propagator of the $\phi$ field
\begin{equation}
  G_\phi = \frac{1}{p^2-M^2+i\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore we need the result of the Feynman loop\-/diagram given in
\cref{fig:twoPointFunctionSelfEnergy}
\begin{equation}
  \Ima \mathcal{M}^{Loop} = \frac{\lambda^2}{32 \pi} \sqrt{1 - 4\frac{m^2}{M^2}} \theta(M - 2m)
\end{equation}
Summing over all possible self\-/energy graphs we get a geometric series
\begin{equation}
  i G(p^2) = \frac{i}{p^2 - m_R^2 + \Sigma(p^2) + i\epsilon },
\end{equation}
where we can plugin the free propagator and the result of the loop diagram of
our toy\-/Lagrangian to get a typical spectral function
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \rho(q^2) &= -\frac{1}{\pi} \Ima \Pi(q^2) \\
    &= \frac{1}{\pi} \Ima \left[ p^2 - M^2 + i\epsilon + \frac{\lambda^2}{32 \pi} \sqrt{1 - 4\frac{m^2}{M^2}} \theta(M - 2m) \right]^{-1} \\
    &= \delta(q^2 - M^2) + \theta(q^2 - 4m^2)\frac{\lambda^2}{32 \pi^2}
    \frac{1}{(q^2 - M^2)^2} \sqrt{\frac{q^2 - 4m^2}{q^2}},
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we have used \cref{eq:cuttingRules}.


\textcolor{red}{correct sum up} What have we done so far: The scalar QCD two
point function can then be described by the spectrum of hadronic states. The
correlator is then related to an integral over the \textit{spectral function}
$\rho(s)$ via the \textit{Källén-Lehmann spectral representation}
\cite{Kallen1952,Lehmann1954}, which is known since the early fifties
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dispersionRelation}
  \Pi(q^2) = \int_0^\infty \dif s \frac{\rho(s)}{s - q^2 - i \epsilon}.
\end{equation}

\Cref{eq:dispersionRelation} is referred to as \textit{dispersion relation}
analogous to similar relations which arise for example in electrodynamics and
defines the \textit{spectral function} (a derivation can be found in
\cite{Rafael1997})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:spectralFunction}
  \rho(s) = \frac{1}{\pi} \Ima \Pi(s).
\end{equation}

Until know we connected theoretical correlator with the measurable hadronic
spectrum. Nevertheless the analytic properties of the correlators have to be
discussed as the function has discontinuities.

The main contribution from the spectral function given in
\cref{eq:dispersionRelation} are the hadronic final states
\begin{equation}
  2 \pi \rho(m^2) = \sum_n \langle  0 | J_\mu(x) | n \rangle \langle n | J_\nu(y) \rangle (2 \pi^2)^4 \delta^{(4)}(p - p_n),
\end{equation}
which lead to a series of continuous poles on the positive real axis for the
two-point function (see Fig. \cref{fig:analyticStructureCorrelator}).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/analyticStructureCorrelator.eps}
  \caption{Analytic structure in the complex $q^2$-plane of the Fourier
    transform of the two-point function. The hadronic final states are
    responsible for poles appearing on the real-axis. The one-particle states
    contribute as isolated pole and the multi-particle states contribute as
    bound-states poles or a continues ``discontinuity cut'' \cite{Peskin1995}.}
  \label{fig:analyticStructureCorrelator}
\end{figure}


The vacuum expectation value of the product of the conserved Noether current
$J_\mu(x)$ at different space-time points $x$ and $y$ is known as the
\textbf{two-point function} (or simply \textbf{correlator})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:twoPointFunction}
  \Pi_{\mu\nu}(q^2) = \int \dif x \, e^{iqx} \langle  0 | J_\mu(x) J_\nu(0) | 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where the Noether current is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcdCurrent}
  J_\mu(x) = \anti{q}(x) \Gamma q(x),
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ can be any of the following dirac matrices $\Gamma \in \{ 1,
i\gamma_5, \gamma_\mu, \gamma_\mu\gamma_5\}$, specifying the quantum number of
the current (S: \textit{scalar}, P: \textit{pseudo-Scalar}, V:
\textit{vectorial}, A: \textit{axial-vectorial}, respectively).

The vector correlator $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(q^2)$ can be Lorentz decomposed to a scalar
function $\Pi(q^2)$. There are only two possible terms that can reproduce the
second order tensor $q_\mu q_\nu$ and $q^2 g_{\mu\nu}$. The sum of both
multiplied with two arbitrary functions $A(q^2)$ and $B(q^2)$ yields
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{\mu\nu}(q^2) = q_\mu q_\nu A(q^2) + q^2 g_{\mu\nu} B(q^2).
\end{equation}
By making use of the \textit{Ward\-/identity}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wardIdentity}
  \begin{split}
    q^\mu \Pi_{\mu\nu} &= \int \dif x q^\mu e^{iqx} \langle 0 \vert  J_\mu(x) J_\nu(0) \vert 0 \rangle \\
    &= -i \int \dif x i q^\mu e^{i q^\nu x_\nu} \langle 0 \vert J_\mu(x) J_\nu(0) \vert 0 \rangle \\
    &= i \int \dif x e^{iqx} \langle 0 \vert \partial_\mu[J_\mu(x)] J_\nu(0)
    \vert 0 \rangle \\
    &= 0, \quad \text{with} \quad \partial_\mu J_\mu(x) = 0,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we used $i q^\mu e^{i q^\nu x_\nu} = \partial_\mu e^{i q^\nu x_\nu}$ in
the second and integration by parts in the third line. The Ward identity is
dependent on the conserved Noether\-/current $J_\mu$ and thus only holds for
same flavour quarks. With the Ward\-/identity we are able to demonstrate, that
the two arbitrary functions are related
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    q^\mu q^\nu \Pi_{\mu\nu} &= q^4 A(q^2) + q^4 B(q^2) = 0 \\
    &\quad \implies A(q^2) = -B(q^2).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus redefining $A(q^2) \equiv \Pi(q^2)$ we expressed the correlator as a scalar
function
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{\mu\nu}(q^2) = (q_\mu q_\nu - q^2 g_{\mu\nu})\Pi(q^2).
\end{equation}





These discontinuities can be tackled with \textit{Cauchy's theorem}, which we
will apply in \cref{sec:sumRules}.

Having dealt exclusively with the perturbative part of the theory, we have to
discuss non\-/perturbative contributions, as \textsc{qcd} is known to have
non\-/negligible contributions. Thus before continuing with the \textit{Sum
  Rules} we need a final ingredient the \define{ope}{Operator Product
  Expansion}, which treats the non\-/perturbative contributions of our theory.




\subsection{Operator Product Expansion}
The \textsc{ope} was introduced by Wilson in 1969 \cite{Wilson1969}. The
expansion states that non\-/local operators can be rewritten into a sum of
composite local operators and their corresponding coefficients:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ope}
  \lim_{x\to y} \mathcal{O}_1(x) \mathcal{O}_2(y) = \sum_n C_n(x-y)\mathcal{O}_n(x),
\end{equation}
where $C_n(x-y)$ are the so-called \textit{Wilson-coefficients}.

The OPE lets us separate short-distance from long-distance effects. In
\textsc{pt} we can only amount for short-distances, which are equal to height
energies, where the strong-coupling $\alpha_s$ is small. Consequently the
\textsc{ope} decodes the long-distance effects in the higher dimensional
operators.

The form of the composite operators are dictated by Gauge- and Lorentz symmetry.
Thus we can only make use of operators of even dimension. The operators up to
dimension six are given by \cite{Pascual1984}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \text{Dimension 0:} & \mathbb{1} \\
    \text{Dimension 4:} & :m_i \anti{q} q: \\
                        & :G_a^{\mu\nu}(x) G_{\mu\nu}^a(x): \\
    \text{Dimension 6:} & :\anti{q} \Gamma q \anti{q} \Gamma q: \\
                        & :\anti{q} \Gamma \frac{\lambda^a}{2} q_\beta(x) \anti{q} \Gamma \frac{\lambda^a}{2} q: \\
                        & :m_i \anti{q} \frac{\lambda^a}{2} \sigma_{\mu\nu} q G^{\mu\nu}_a: \\
                        & :f_{abc} G_a^{\mu\nu} G_b^{\nu\delta} G_c^{\delta\mu}:,
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ stands for one of possible dirac matrices (as seen
\cref{eq:qcdCurrent}). As all the operators appear normal ordered they vanish by
definition in \textsc{pt}. Consequently they appear as \textit{condensates} in
\textsc{npt qcd} like quark-condensate $\langle \anti{q} q \rangle$ or the
gluon-condensate $\langle a GG \rangle$ (both of dimension four). These
non-vanishing condensates characterise the \textsc{qcd}-vacuum.

As we work with dimensionless functions (e.g. the correlator $\Pi$) in Sum
Rules, the r.h.s. of \cref{eq:ope} has to be dimensionless. Consequently the
Wilson-coefficients have to cancel the dimension of the operator with their
inverse mass dimension. To account for the dimensions we can make the inverse
momenta explicit
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{V/A}^{OPE}(s) = \sum_{D=0,2,4\dots} \frac{c^{(D)} \langle \mathcal{O}^{(D)}(x) \rangle}{-s^{D/2}},
\end{equation}
where we used $C^{(D)}=c/(-s)^{D/2}$ with $D$ being the dimension. Consequently
the \textsc{ope} should converge with increasing dimension for sufficiently
large momenta $s$.

Let's show how the \textsc{ope} contributions are calculated with a the
``standard example'' (following \cite{Pascual1984}), where we compute the
perturbative and quark-condensate Wilson-coefficients for the $\rho$-meson. For
the $\rho$-meson, which is composed of u and d quarks, the current of
\cref{eq:twoPointFunction} takes the following form
\begin{equation}
  j^\mu(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(:[\anti{u} \gamma^\mu u](x) - \anti{d} \gamma^\mu d](x)\right).
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/condensateFeynmanDiagram.eps}
  \caption{Feynman diagrams of the perturbative (a) and the quark-condensate (b)
    contribution. The upper part of the right diagram is not wick-contracted and
    responsible for the condensate.}
  \label{fig:OPEFeynmanDiagram}
\end{figure}
In \cref{fig:OPEFeynmanDiagram} we draw the Feynman-diagram, from which we can
take the uncontracted mathematical expression for the scalar correlator
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Pi(q^2) &= - \frac{i}{4 q^2 (D -1)} \int \dif^D x e^{iqx} \langle \Omega \vert T \{:\anti{u}(x) \gamma^\mu u(x) - \anti{d}(x) \gamma^\mu d(x): \\
    &\quad\times :\anti{u}(0 \gamma_\mu u(0) - \anti{d}(0)\gamma_\mu d(0): \}
    \rangle.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using Wick's theorem we can contract all of the fields and calculate the first
term of the OPE ($\mathbb{1}$), which represents the perturbative contribution
of the OPE ($\mathbb{1}$)
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Pi(q^2) &= \frac{i}{4q^2(D-1)} (\gamma^\mu)_{ij} (\gamma_\mu)_{kl} \int \dif^D x e^{iqx} \\
    &\times\quad\left[ \wick{ \c u_{j \alpha}(x) \anti{\c u}_{k \beta}(0)} \cdot
      \wick{\c u_{l \beta}(0) \anti{\c u}_{i \alpha}(x)} + (u \to d)
    \right] \\
    &= \frac{3}{8\pi^2} \left[ \frac{5}{3} - \log\left( -\frac{q^2}{\nu^2}
      \right) \right].
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

To calculate the higher dimensional contributions of the OPE we use the same
techniques as before, but leave some of the fields uncontracted. For the
quark-condensate, which we want to derive for tree-level, we leave two fields
uncontracted
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Pi(q^2) &= \frac{i}{4q^2(D-1)} (\gamma^\mu)_{ij} (\gamma_\mu)_{kl} \int \dif^D x e^{iqx} \left[ \phantom{\wick{ \c u_{j \alpha}(x) \anti{\c u}_{k \beta}(0)}} \right.\\
    &\quad+\,\wick{ \c u_{j \alpha}(x) \anti{\c u}_{k \beta}(0)} \cdot \langle \Omega \vert : \anti{u}_{i \alpha}(x) u_{l \beta} (0) :\vert \Omega \rangle \\
    &\quad\,\left.+\wick{\c u_{l \beta}(0) \anti{\c u}_{i \alpha}(x)} \cdot
      \langle \Omega \vert: \anti{u}_{k \beta}(0) u_{j \alpha}(x) : \vert \Omega
      \rangle + (u \to d) \right].
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The non contracted fields can then be expanded in $x$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle \Omega \vert: \anti{q}(x) q(0):\vert \Omega \rangle &= \langle\Omega\vert: \anti{q}(0) q(0): \vert\Omega\rangle\\
    &\quad+ \langle\Omega\vert:\left[ \partial_\mu \anti{q}(0) \right]
    q(0):\vert\Omega\rangle x^\mu + \dots
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and redefined to a more elegant notation
\begin{equation}
  \langle \anti{q}q \rangle \equiv \langle\Omega\vert: \anti{q}(0) q(0):\vert\Omega\rangle.
\end{equation}
The finally result can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{(\rho)}(q^2) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\left(-q^2\right)^2} \left[ m_u\langle \anti{u} u \rangle + m_d \langle \anti{d} d \rangle\right].
\end{equation}

The usage of the \textsc{ope} and its validity is far from obvious. We are
deriving the \textsc{ope} from matching the Wilson-coefficients to Feynman-graph
analyses. These Feynman-graphs are calculated perturbatively but the
coefficients with dimension $D>0$ correspond to \textsc{npt} condensates!

Having gathered all of the necessary concepts we can close the gap between the
theory and experiment in the last section of the introduction: \textsc{qcdsr}.


\subsection{Sum Rules}
\label{sec:sumRules}
To relate the measurable hadronic final states of a \textsc{qcd} process (e.g.
$\tau$-decays into hadrons) to a theoretical calculable \textsc{qcdsr} have been
employed by Shifman in the late seventies \cite{Shifman1978}.

The sum rules are a combination of the two-point function, its analyticity, the
\textsc{ope}, a dispersion relation, the optical theorem and quark hadron
duality.

The previously introduced two-point function \cref{eq:twoPointFunction} is
generally described by the \textsc{ope} to account for \textsc{npt} effects.
\begin{equation}
  \Pi(q^2) = \Pi^{OPE}(q^2).
\end{equation}
Furthermore it is related to the theoretical spectral function $\rho(s)$ via a
dispersion relation (\cref{eq:dispersionRelation}). Using \textsc{qcd} we are
computing interactions based on quarks and gluons, but as we have seen
(confinement), we are only able to observe hadrons. Consequently to connect the
theory to the experiment we have to assume \textbf{quark-hadron
  duality}\footnote{Or simply duality.}, which implies that physical quantities
can be described equally good in the hadronic or in the quark-gluon picture.
Thus we rewrite the dispersion relation \cref{eq:dispersionRelation} as
\begin{equation}
  \Pi^{OPE}_{th}(q^2) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\rho_{exp}(q^2)}{(s-q^2-i\epsilon)},
\end{equation}
where we connected the theoretical correlator $\Pi_{th}$ with the experimental
measurable spectral function $\rho_{exp}$.

We have seen, that the theoretical description of the correlator $\Pi_{th}$
contains poles on the real axis. Unfortunately the experimental data
$\rho_{exp}$ is solely accessible on the positive real axis. As a result we have
to make use of Cauchy's theorem to access the theoretical values of the
two-point function close to the positive real axis (see
\cref{fig:correlatorComplexContour}), which is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cauchysTheorem}
  \int_{\mathcal{C}} f(z) \dif z = 0,
\end{equation}
where $f(z)$ is an analytic function on a closed contour $\mathcal{C}$.

  \caption{Analytical structure of $\Pi(s)$ with the used contour $\mathcal{C}$
    for the final QCD Sum Rule expression \cref{eq:qcdSumRules}.}
\end{figure}

The final ingredient of the \textsc{qcd} sum rules is the \textit{optical
  theorem}, relating experimental data with the imaginary part of the correlator
(the spectral function $\rho(s)$).

In total, with the help Cauchy's theorem, the \textsc{qcd} sum rules can be
summed up in the following expression
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcdSumRules}
  \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty \frac{\rho_{exp}(t)}{t - s}\dif t = \frac{1}{\pi} \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \frac{\Ima \Pi_{OPE}(t)}{t -s}\dif t,
\end{equation}
where the l.h.s. is given by the experiment and the r.h.s. can be theoretically
evaluated by applying the \textsc{ope} of the correlator $\Pi_{OPE}(s)$.
